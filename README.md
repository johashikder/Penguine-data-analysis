ðŸ“ˆ Key Analyses Conducted
<br>

ðŸ”¹ 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<br>
Checked for missing values and handled them using appropriate imputation techniques.<br>
Summarized the dataset to understand species distribution.<br>
Visualized numerical features such as body mass, flipper length, culmen dimensions, etc.
<br>
ðŸ”¹ 2. Species Comparison<br>
Used boxplots and density plots to compare bill length, bill depth, and body mass among the three species.<br>
Conducted ANOVA and t-tests to check for significant differences between species.
<br>
ðŸ”¹ 3. Correlation Analysis<br>
Examined relationships between flipper length, body mass, and culmen dimensions.<br>
Created correlation heatmaps to identify strong dependencies between features.
<br>
ðŸ”¹ 4. Classification Model<br>
Built a decision tree model to classify penguins based on their morphological features.<br>
Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
<br>

ðŸ”¬ Key Findings<br>
âœ… Species Differentiation:
<br>
Gentoo penguins tend to have the largest body mass and longest flippers.<br>
Adelie penguins have shorter flippers but intermediate culmen measurements.<br>
Chinstrap penguins have distinct bill proportions compared to the others.
<br>
âœ… Strong Correlations:
<br>
Flipper length and body mass are positively correlated.<br>
Culmen depth is a key identifier in distinguishing between species.
<br>
âœ… Machine Learning Model Performance:
<br>

The decision tree classifier achieved ~95% accuracy in predicting penguin species based on morphological traits.<br>
